    "# Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are an ensemble learning method that can be used for\n",
    "classification or regression by constructing several individual \n",
    "decision trees as opposed to just one. \n",
    "\n",
    "For classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each decision tree in the forest gives a class prediction, and whichever class is selected most often is the output of the random forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output of the random forest is the average prediction of the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Random Forests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting that sometimes occurs in decision trees and improves accuracy\n",
    "- Can handle large datasets as well as missing data\n",
    "- Can perform both classification and regression tasks\n",
    "- Produces good predictions that can be easily understood\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Random Forests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires more computational power and resources\n",
    "- Consumes more time compared to a decision tree algorithm\n",
