# Random Forests

Random forests are an ensemble learning method that can be used for
classification or regression by constructing several individual 
decision trees as opposed to just one. 

For classification:

- Each decision tree in the forest gives a class prediction, and whichever class is selected most often is the output of the random forest.

For regression:

- The output of the random forest is the average prediction of the individual trees.
