# Statistical Tests and Models


> [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/about.html#about-statsmodels)
> is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the
> estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for
> conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An
> extensive list of result statistics are available for each
> estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical
> packages to ensure that they are correct. The package is released
> under the open source Modified BSD (3-clause) license. The online
> documentation is hosted at <statsmodels.org>.


> `statsmodels` supports specifying models using R-style formulas and
> `pandas DataFrames`.


There are multiple Python libraries/packages that allow you to perform
complex statistical tests and build various models.
